# Scripts

## Setup

These scripts rely on a few Ruby gems. To run `word_counter.rb`, install the
`fast-stemmer`, `lemmatizer`, and `stopwords` gems. The `stopwords` gem
provides a dictionary of common English stop words used by the script:

```bash
gem install fast-stemmer lemmatizer stopwords
```

## Usage

```bash
./word_counter.rb sample.md
```
